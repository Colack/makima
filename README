Monitor And Keeping IT Maintenance Active or Makima is a utility tool that takes input as chromebook data and turns it into a json format.

You can find the source code for the different builds in each specified directory. `./windows` is for Windows, `./linux` is for Linux, and `./macOS` is for macOS. 

You can compile for each platform using the following scripts:

    `./winBuild.bat` - Windows compilation using batch script
    `./linBuild.sh` - Linux compilation using bash
    `Coming soon` - I will find a way to compile using Mac.

Thanks for using Makima!
