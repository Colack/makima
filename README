Monitor And Keeping IT Maintenance Active or Makima is a utility tool that takes input as chromebook data and turns it into a json format.

You can find the source code for the different builds in each specified directory. `./windows` is for Windows, `./linux` is for Linux, and `./macOS` is for macOS. 

You can compile all C builds using these commands:

    Windows: `gcc -o makima ./windows/core.c ./windows/lib.c`
    macOS (OS-X): `gcc -o makima ./macOS/main.c`

and for C++ builds:

    Windows: `g++ -o makima ./windows-new/main.cpp ./windows-new/makima.cpp`

All executables will be called `Makima`

There are some plans to make a installer for the program that puts the executable into the system environment variables (for windows,) but that will be in the future when the program gets out of Alpha & Beta.
